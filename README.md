# CFPT: Empowering Time Series Forecasting through Cross-Frequency Interaction and Periodic-Aware Timestamp Modeling

This repo is the official implementation for the paper: [CFPT: Empowering Time Series Forecasting through Cross-Frequency Interaction and Periodic-Aware Timestamp Modeling]. The paper has been accepted by ICML 2025.


## Usage 

1. Multivariate datasets can be obtained from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing) orÂ [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy).

2. Install Pytorch and other necessary dependencies (python==3.9.20).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts under the folder ./scripts/. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
bash ./scripts/ECL.sh
```
